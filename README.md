This project illustrates the use of Angular to create a portfolio page with my personal, educational, work experience and contact information.

## Components

This application uses 5 components:
* Home
  A content page component used as default route and which holds personal information.

* Education
  Another content page component that holds my education information.

* Professional
  A content page component that holds my work experience information.

* Contact
  The last content page component with all of my main contacts.

* Navbar
  Lastly a navbar that is used in all of the latter content pages.

## Material Components

The app also uses some of the Material Design components of `@angular/material` package such as:
* toolbar
* menu
* button
* card
* icon
etc.

## Binding and string interpolation

As a use case a interpolation was used at HomeComponent to show my current age whenever the user accesses the page. It is calculated using current date difference from my birth date.

## Style

Some custom additional style was made to the components just for playing around and understanding the framework.
